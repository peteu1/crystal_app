agate,,"Agates are earth stones. Overall, agates are gentle, nourishing, and strengthening, with a lower intensity than many other gemstones. Individual types of agate have their own personal healing properties.",,
agates,,,,"Agate is an umbrella name for a number of varieties of banded chalcedony. Agate crystals occurs in many colors that range from translucent to opaque. Agates are found all over the world. Some agates are geodes, which means they are hollow in the middle, often with crystals inside. Agate is considered a semi-precious gemstone.
Agates grow in many different types of rock, and through many different processes. As such, their hardness can vary greatly, but is generally somewhere between a six and an eight on the Mohs scale. Agate is a member of the quartz family of gemstones, and often you will find agates with bands of quartz and chalcedony layered through it. Agates are found all over the world. Africa, Asia, Brazil, Egypt, Germany, England, India, Italy, Mexico, Nepal, Canada, and the United States all have varieties of Agates that are found there. Agates are most often found round instead of any other shape.
Agates have been used by humans dating back to the Neolithic period, and were used by early Egyptians and in ancient India.
Agates are for the most part quite durable stones. They can be dyed different colors, sliced exceptionally thin, and aside from doing a real number on your blades because they‚Äôre so hard, are quite nice to work with in jewelry. Agates provide unlimited options to work with because of the sheer number of types of agates there are in the world. Pricewise, some agates (like the Fire Agate for example) can end up being quite pricey for a good quality piece; but for the most part agates are very affordable stones, and great for beginners.

alexandrite,,"Rather than just bring you joy, Alexandrite helps you develop your own source of joy within yourself. It facilitates an awareness of the beauty of every moment, and your power to choose and make the most of your life. It provides hope by means of awareness of the possibilities that are always available to you, no matter your circumstances.",8.5,"Alexandrite is a member of the chrysoberyl family of stone, some of the rarest stones on earth. (Despite the similar name, they are not related to the beryl family which includes emerald, aquamarine, and morganite). It sits at a 8.5 on the Moh‚Äôs scale, making it one of the hardest gemstones.
Alexandrite has an optical property called pleochroism which means that it appears to change color when viewed at different angles. In addition to being pleochroic, it also changes color based on the ambient light source. Under incandescent lighting it will appear purplish-red, but in daylight it will appear bluish-green. This effect is due to the way it absorbs yellow light while transmitting blue and red light.
Alexandrite was discovered in Russia in the 1830s, and named such to honor the Russian Tsar Alexander II. Originally, alexandrite was thought to only be found in Russia, but a Brazilian deposit was discovered in the late 1980s and others soon followed. Today, small deposits of alexandrite are found in Russia, Brazil, Zimbabwe, Madagascar, Burma, India, and Sri Lanka; although they are still quite rare, especially for high quality.
Alexandrite is often listed as the birthstone for the month of June, but because of its rarity, pearls are also listed.
Alexandrite is available only from reputable dealers, and it comes at a price. This stone is not for amateurs, and even pieces of lower quality the size of diamond points (.015cts) are expensive. If you are offered it at an exceptionally low price‚Ä¶it‚Äôs probably not alexandrite.

Amazonite is usually found in cabochon form, and is almost never faceted because it is easily fractured. While often used in jewelry, occasionally it can crack. Amazonite has a color rarely seen in the gemstone world, so many jewelers believe it is worth the work. Although amazonite can be hard to find, it is not exceptionally expensive.

Its purple color ranges from light lavender to dark violet and it is usually translucent. Like all quartz, purple amethyst gemstones are a commonly used crystal in metaphysical work. Amethyst is found in many parts of the world. Only a few countries provide darker high-quality gemstones. Other common varieties of quartz include rose quartz and carnelian.
Many stones have fake varieties but there‚Äôs no real point to making synthetic amethyst because natural amethyst is common and inexpensive. The only thing you need to look out for is glass that is only purple colored but fancily named amethyst.
Amethyst is a 7 on the Mohs scale of hardness. The only difference between regular clear quartz crystal and amethyst is the color. The purple is caused by iron and aluminum that were present while the stone was forming. Amethyst is always a shade of purple, sometimes very light, other times very dark. Occasionally you will find red dots or red or blue hues in the stone.
Amethyst and citrine are closely related. Citrine is formed when amethyst is exposed to heat when forming. Sometimes people even call citrine ‚Äúburnt amethyst‚Äù. When citrine and amethyst are found together in one piece, it is called ametrine and is very sought after.
Amethyst is the birthstone for February. It also has meaning to the astrological signs Pisces, Aries, Aquarius, and Sagittarius.
Amethyst crystal is produced in Russia, India, Brazil, US, Canada, Australia, and South Korea.
Amethyst jewelry and other uses date back to Neolithic times 25,000 years ago. It has often been associated with royalty, and used in crowns and royal rings. It was once a precious stone, but it is now common enough to be considered semi-precious.
Yes! It is perfectly safe to submerge amethyst crystals in water. Feel free to shower and bathe with your amethyst, or put it in your water bottle to make a crystal elixir.
There are many ways to cleanse, clear, and activate crystals. The most popular ones are to run it under water, submerge it in a clear stream, put it out in the moonlight, put it near a healthy houseplant, set it on a selenite plate, burn sage or palo santo, or use chimes or singing bowls. Whatever makes you feel clear and peaceful will also help your crystals.
Yes, if left in sunlight, amethyst can begin to fade. It won‚Äôt become a different color, but it will become more pale.
If heat-treated at very high temperatures, amethyst can turn golden-yellow or green, but that won‚Äôt happen at home. üòâ

apatite,[5],Green apatite helps sooth the nervous system and maintain inner balance. Blue apatite enhances psychic awareness and opens the mind to insight and inspiration.,5.0,"Apatite is not a well known gemstone, and actually has more uses outside the field of jewelry. Apatite is a soft stone, and can be very brittle.
Apatite is a mineral that sits at a five on the Mohs Scale. Most commonly seen in green tones, it can also bee found in yellows, pinks, browns, violets, and blues. Apatite crystals typically grow in hexagonal (six sided) shapes.
The name apatite is derived from Greek meaning ‚Äúto deceive‚Äù likely because it was often mistaken for other, more valuable gemstones, like peridot, tourmaline, and emerald. Apatite is found in igneous, sedimentary, and metamorphic rock, but only the latter grows larger crystals suitable for jewelry.
Apatite is found in many different parts of the world: Eastern Canada, Germany, India, Madagascar, Brazil, Burma, Mexico, Czechoslovakia, Mozambique, Norway, South Africa, Spain, Sri Lanka, and the United States.
Because apatite is so soft, a lot of people will lean away from putting apatite in jewelry. However, if a setting is carefully chosen, it can result in a beautiful piece. When shopping for apatite, remember that the more intense the color, the more it is worth.

Aquamarine sits at a 7.5 ‚Äì 8 on the Mohs scale (somewhere between quartz and topaz). It is a member of the beryl family, along with emerald, morganite, and bixbite (red emerald). Aquamarine‚Äôs name comes from Latin, meaning water and sea.
The best quality aquamarine sources are in Brazil. It is also found in Russia, Nigeria, Zambia, Madagascar, Mozambique, Afghanistan, Pakistan, and parts of the United States.
Aquamarine is a favorite stone of many:
In the past, sailors wore aquamarine to ward off seasickness and encourage safe travel. Some saw it as a stone of eternal youth.
Because aquamarine is a hard stone, it is safe for all forms of jewelry, such as rings, pendants, and earrings. It is also hard enough to be faceted for fine jewelry, making it suitable for engagement rings.
Clean your aquamarine often to keep it stunning. The color pales when dirt collects around the stone. Keep this in mind when buying lighter or pale colored stones.
Be careful not to mistake blue topaz gemstones for aquamarine. Topaz is beautiful as well, but is less expensive than aquamarine. Another imitation of aquamarine is a form of spinel called aquamarine spinel.
Aquamarine gems are often heat treated to enhance the color. When purchasing one of these stones, be sure to ask if it is natural or treated.

Azurite is a fairly soft mineral, only a 3.5-4 on the Mohs scale of hardness. Azurite is often found growing alongside malachite, sometimes even growing together in one stone. Geologists and mineralogists use azurite to approximate the location of copper deposits as azurite (as well as malachite) are byproducts of copper, forming as the deposit weathers.
Azurite is found in many parts of the world including the United States, Australia, Chile, Peru, France, Namibia, Russia, and Egypt.
Azurite is a similar blue color to lapis lazuli, although the latter has glittery inclusions that are not present in azurite.
Azurite loses the intensity of its color over time if exposed to light, heat, and open air. Its softness means it will not hold up in all settings and because heating destroys azurite, only cold settings can be used. When wearing azurite, be careful to not wear it for long periods of time outside, and store it in a sealed container if possible away from harder stones that could scratch it. This will help maintain the brilliant color.

It is a relatively hard stone, a 7 on the Mohs Scale of Hardness. Bloodstone is found primarily in India, but also found in Australia, Brazil, China, Russia, and the Czech Republic.
In the Middle Ages, people believed the red spots found on bloodstone were drops of the blood of Jesus that turned to stone when they fell from his body onto the earth during the crucifixion.
Bloodstone has a unique and uncommon color combination, which can sometimes make it challenging to combine with other beads in jewelry without the results seeming too ‚Äúbusy‚Äù. Therefore it may be best suited as a solo piece such as in a pendant.
No two pieces are alike. Quality, location, and other factors affect the look of a finished bloodstone piece, so matching new pieces with an existing piece can prove difficult.

Fluorite is transparent in most cases. The most commonly recognized fluorite color is a purple-blue mix but it is also found in blue, green, red and yellow colors.
Fluorite sits at a 4 on the Mohs Scale, which is very soft. The word ‚Äúflourescent‚Äù is derived from flourite. Flourescence is the property of emitting light that has been absorbed previously‚Äìin essence, glowing. Generally minerals that are flourescent absorb ultra-violet light and then emit visible light, therefore the effect can only be seen by shining a UV light (black light) on them.
Not all flourite is flourescent. Pieces harvested side by side from the same site can respond differently to black light‚Äìthe effect depends on the exact mineral makeup of each specimen.
Fluorite is found in many parts of the world including Germany, Austria, Switzerland, England, Norway, Mexico, Canada (Ontario), and the U.S. The largest producer of fluorite in the U.S. is Illinois, and is in fact their state mineral. Fluorite is also found in Missouri, Oklahoma, Colorado, New Mexico, Kentucky, Arizona, Ohio, New Hampshire, New York and Texas.
Flourite is relatively inexpensive, and surprisingly durable despite its softness, making it an excellent option for many designs.

jade,[4],"Green jade carries the energy of the Earth and nature, providing a wholesome, nurturing energy that uplifts and soothes the heart. It draws the abundance of nature into your life, helping you create physical prosperity and wellbeing.",,"Jade is actually two different minerals referred to by the same name. For centuries, two separate minerals were referred to and traded as jade because of their similarities. By the time a French mineralogist realized they were two different gems in the 1800s, it was too late. Today, they are differentiated into jadeite and nephrite, but often the two are still just called and sold as ‚Äújade‚Äù. Nephrite jade has long been revered by the Chinese, where it is called ‚ÄòYu‚Äô. It is believed to reduce stress, and prolong life.
Nephrite Jade is a 6 to 6.5 and Jadeite is a 6 to 7 on the Mohs scale. Neither jade is an exceptionally hard stone, but both are very tough due to their microcrystalline structure. Because of this durability, jade was used by earlier civilizations for axes and weapons. Jade is an important part of the Chinese wedding ceremony as it is considered the concentrated essence of love. It has also been carved into ornaments, beads, and statues.
Jadeite is the more expensive variety and was originally introduced to Europe from the Americas where it was found by the conquistadors. It is actually not found in China. This variety of jade is found primarily in Burma and Guatemala. It comes in a wide range of colors including green, mottled green and white, whitish gray, pink, brown, mauve, yellow, orange, and lavender. Green jade of this variety is usually an apple green or emerald color. Colored jade (except green) is usually pale and unevenly tinted. It is more expensive because it is rarer, found in only a dozen places worldwide.
Nephrite jade is more common than jadeite and is found in mostly dark green shades. This type of jade is considered to be the ‚Äúold and true Chinese jade‚Äù. Nephrite is slightly softer than it‚Äôs counterpart and is found in many countries including China, Russia, New Zealand, the United States, and Canada (British Columbia).
Due to jade‚Äôs toughness, it can be worn virtually anywhere. It is often carved and cut into cabochon styles for pendants, earrings, and rings. Jade can also be fashioned into a complete ring, much like the hematite rings you see. There are, however, many imitations of jade. ‚ÄúNew Jade‚Äù is actually a gemstone called serpentine but looks almost identical. The easiest way to tell real jade apart is a basic scratch test (although this still isn‚Äôt a definitive test). Real jade should not be easily scratched by a knife while serpentine and many other imposters are. When purchasing jade, just make sure you trust the source and you should be fine. White jade can also be died to produce bright colors.

Colors of jasper include grayish blue, green, off-white, white, yellow, orange, red, pink, black, and brown. Jasper very rarely has a uniform color, as it often has other materials mixed in with it.

Jet is a non-crystalline organic gemstone formed by natural processes, like amber, pearl, and shungite. Jet sometimes contains inclusions of pyrite, giving it some sparkle.
Jet has been used in carvings and amulets since the Neolithic period. In Rome it was used in protective amulets, and the Victorians used it for rosary beads and jewelry to wear in periods of mourning. Jet is soft compared to say, sapphire, but it can be polished to a high-sheen and is relatively durable as a gemstone.
Whitby Jet is produced in Whitby, England, and is considered very high quality.
French Jet is not actually jet‚Äìit is black glass made to simulate jet. It became popular in the 19th century and is still easy to find in antiques. Real jet is lighter and warmer to the touch than glass.

The result is increased confidence, assertiveness, creativity, and the ability to do what it takes to create what you want.",6.25,"Pyrite is an iron sulfide also known as ‚Äúfool‚Äôs gold‚Äù due to its superficial resemblance to gold and it being much more common. The name pyrite comes from the greek word for fire, because you can produce a spark when hitting two pieces of pyrite together, or striking it against steel. Pyrite is used in industry to produce sulfur dioxide and sulfuric acid. It is also sometimes used as a component in lithium batteries. Historically it has been used in radios and inside early firearms, and in ancient times it was polished to use as a mirror. It is also sometimes found as a replacement mineral in fossils. It forms into various crystal shapes, including strikingly large cubes. It is found all over the world, but larger and more prized specimens have been found in Bolivia, Spain, Italy, and Germany.
Pyrite was used in marcasite jewelry, as it is similar to marcasite but more durable. Marcasite jewelry consists of small pieces of pyrite set into silver, and has been made since ancient Greece. It enjoyed a period of popularity in the Victorian era, and today‚Äôs marcasite jewelry tends to replicate these designs for a ‚Äúvintage‚Äù look.
Pyrite can be used alone in jewelry, but it can also be found as inclusions inside other gemstones such as lapis lazuli.
