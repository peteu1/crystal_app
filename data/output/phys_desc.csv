agates,"Agate is an umbrella name for a number of varieties of banded chalcedony. Agate crystals occurs in many colors that range from translucent to opaque. Agates are found all over the world. Some agates are geodes, which means they are hollow in the middle, often with crystals inside. Agate is considered a semi-precious gemstone.
Agates grow in many different types of rock, and through many different processes. As such, their hardness can vary greatly, but is generally somewhere between a six and an eight on the Mohs scale. Agate is a member of the quartz family of gemstones, and often you will find agates with bands of quartz and chalcedony layered through it. Agates are found all over the world. Africa, Asia, Brazil, Egypt, Germany, England, India, Italy, Mexico, Nepal, Canada, and the United States all have varieties of Agates that are found there. Agates are most often found round instead of any other shape.
Agates have been used by humans dating back to the Neolithic period, and were used by early Egyptians and in ancient India.
Agates are for the most part quite durable stones. They can be dyed different colors, sliced exceptionally thin, and aside from doing a real number on your blades because they‚Äôre so hard, are quite nice to work with in jewelry. Agates provide unlimited options to work with because of the sheer number of types of agates there are in the world. Pricewise, some agates (like the Fire Agate for example) can end up being quite pricey for a good quality piece; but for the most part agates are very affordable stones, and great for beginners.
"
alexandrite,"Alexandrite is a member of the chrysoberyl family of stone, some of the rarest stones on earth. (Despite the similar name, they are not related to the beryl family which includes emerald, aquamarine, and morganite). It sits at a 8.5 on the Moh‚Äôs scale, making it one of the hardest gemstones.
Alexandrite has an optical property called pleochroism which means that it appears to change color when viewed at different angles. In addition to being pleochroic, it also changes color based on the ambient light source. Under incandescent lighting it will appear purplish-red, but in daylight it will appear bluish-green. This effect is due to the way it absorbs yellow light while transmitting blue and red light.
Alexandrite was discovered in Russia in the 1830s, and named such to honor the Russian Tsar Alexander II. Originally, alexandrite was thought to only be found in Russia, but a Brazilian deposit was discovered in the late 1980s and others soon followed. Today, small deposits of alexandrite are found in Russia, Brazil, Zimbabwe, Madagascar, Burma, India, and Sri Lanka; although they are still quite rare, especially for high quality.
Alexandrite is often listed as the birthstone for the month of June, but because of its rarity, pearls are also listed.
Alexandrite is available only from reputable dealers, and it comes at a price. This stone is not for amateurs, and even pieces of lower quality the size of diamond points (.015cts) are expensive. If you are offered it at an exceptionally low price‚Ä¶it‚Äôs probably not alexandrite.
"
amazonite,"Amazonite is a brilliant green to bluish-green variety of feldspar. It is sometimes called ‚ÄúAmazon Stone‚Äù, and was named after the Amazon River. However, the original green stones found near the Amazon were probably not actually Amazonite. The biggest deposits are in Russia, but it has also been found in the USA, Brazil, and Madagascar. Amazonite is a 6 on the Mohs scale.
Amazonite is usually found in cabochon form, and is almost never faceted because it is easily fractured. While often used in jewelry, occasionally it can crack. Amazonite has a color rarely seen in the gemstone world, so many jewelers believe it is worth the work. Although amazonite can be hard to find, it is not exceptionally expensive.
"
amber,"Amber is fossilized sap or pitch from trees, and is usually golden brown and translucent. It can contain bits of plant material or insects that were trapped in the sap and became fossilized with it. Amber has been used in jewelry for thousands of years.
"
amethyst,"Amethyst is a purple variety of quartz crystal. Its purple color ranges from light lavender to dark violet and it is usually translucent. Like all quartz, purple amethyst gemstones are a commonly used crystal in metaphysical work. Amethyst is found in many parts of the world. Only a few countries provide darker high-quality gemstones. Other common varieties of quartz include rose quartz and carnelian.
Many stones have fake varieties but there‚Äôs no real point to making synthetic amethyst because natural amethyst is common and inexpensive. The only thing you need to look out for is glass that is only purple colored but fancily named amethyst.
Amethyst is a 7 on the Mohs scale of hardness. The only difference between regular clear quartz crystal and amethyst is the color. The purple is caused by iron and aluminum that were present while the stone was forming. Amethyst is always a shade of purple, sometimes very light, other times very dark. Occasionally you will find red dots or red or blue hues in the stone.
Amethyst and citrine are closely related. Citrine is formed when amethyst is exposed to heat when forming. Sometimes people even call citrine ‚Äúburnt amethyst‚Äù. When citrine and amethyst are found together in one piece, it is called ametrine and is very sought after.
Amethyst is the birthstone for February. It also has meaning to the astrological signs Pisces, Aries, Aquarius, and Sagittarius.
Amethyst crystal is produced in Russia, India, Brazil, US, Canada, Australia, and South Korea.
Amethyst jewelry and other uses date back to Neolithic times 25,000 years ago. It has often been associated with royalty, and used in crowns and royal rings. It was once a precious stone, but it is now common enough to be considered semi-precious.
Yes! It is perfectly safe to submerge amethyst crystals in water. Feel free to shower and bathe with your amethyst, or put it in your water bottle to make a crystal elixir.
There are many ways to cleanse, clear, and activate crystals. The most popular ones are to run it under water, submerge it in a clear stream, put it out in the moonlight, put it near a healthy houseplant, set it on a selenite plate, burn sage or palo santo, or use chimes or singing bowls. Whatever makes you feel clear and peaceful will also help your crystals.
Yes, if left in sunlight, amethyst can begin to fade. It won‚Äôt become a different color, but it will become more pale.
If heat-treated at very high temperatures, amethyst can turn golden-yellow or green, but that won‚Äôt happen at home. üòâ
Amethyst is the birthstone for February.
Yes! We have a whole page of Amethyst Engagement Rings.
The word amethyst comes from Greek and means ‚Äúto not intoxicate‚Äù. Amethyst meaning among ancient Greeks and Romans included being used to cure drunkenness. Amethyst has also been used for help with insomnia, grief, and addictions.
Amethyst gemstones are very popular in jewelry. They are hard enough to be durable and are readily available and affordable. Even high-grade material is relatively inexpensive. They are also available in a huge range of sizes and shapes. Amethyst jewelry is beautiful, powerful, and beneficial!
"
ametrine,"Ametrine is a combination of amethyst and citrine, which are both varieties of quartz. Citrine is formed when amethyst is exposed to heat, whether naturally or artificially. Ametrine is thus a stone which has been partially transformed from amethyst to citrine, retaining properties of both.
"
citrine,"Citrine is a beautiful yellow gemstone with a color that ranges from light to dark. High quality citrine is transparent, while lower grade style, like those used in beading, can have an opaque look to it. Citrine is sometimes mistaken for the more expensive yellow topaz.
Citrine sits at a 7 on the Mohs Scale. It is a member of the quartz family along with onyx, carnelian, and amethyst.
Natural citrine is very rare and is found in small amounts in only a few places in the world. Russia, Spain, France, and Hungary are known for natural citrine. Most citrine you see on the market is actually amethyst or smoky quartz that has been heat treated. The heat treatment changes to color of the stone to a shade of yellow. It is difficult to tell natural citrine from heat treated citrine unless you are a gemologist and know what to look for.
There aren‚Äôt many yellow gemstones, and there are even fewer that are affordable. Citrine is a wonderful option that offers a wide range of color in the yellow spectrum. When buying any citrine bead or stone, if it isn‚Äôt specified, you should assume you are dealing with a heat treated stone.
Natural citrine has always been rare, and this technique of heat treating other quartz stones has been commonplace for many years. In the gemstone business, this is believed to be common knowledge, so heat treating in this particular case is not considered to be enhancing the stone, simply making it available to the general public.
Citrine is the birthstone for November, and the planetary stone for Virgo. Citrine is also the gemstone for the 13th and 17th year of marriage.
"
angel aura quartz,"Angel Aura Quartz is an iridescent gemstone made by heating quartz crystals and then coating them in powdered silver and platinum. The process creates a beautiful rainbow sheen that is permanent.
"
quartz,"Quartz is a crystal consisting of silicon dioxide. Many gemstones are a variety of quartz, such as citrine, agate, amethyst, rose quartz, smokey quartz, as well as all chalcedony varieties such as carnelian, bloodstone, and jasper.
Clear quartz is also called crystal quartz, quartz crystal, or rock crystal. It can be found in natural crystal formations, or tumbled into beads.
"
angelite,"Angelite is the trade name for a variety of blue anhydrite found in Peru. Anhydrite is a soft calcium sulfate mineral, around 3.5 on the Mohs scale of mineral hardness.
"
apache tears,"A form of obsidian, these nuggets are usually round or oval, black-brown in color, and can be semi-transparent or translucent when polished and held up to light. The name is the result of a legend surrounding the grief of the wives and families of a group of Apache warriors who lept to their death from a cliff after being surrounded and outnumbered in a battle with the U.S. cavalry in the 1870s.
"
obsidian,"Obsidian is a volcanic glass created when lava erupts from a volcano, but only when certain conditions are met:
Obsidian sits at a 5-5.5 on the Mohs scale of hardness. It breaks to form very sharp edges, and was therefore used since ancient times for arrowheads and other tools.
Because is has no crystal structure, obsidian blades can reach molecular thinness. It has been used experimentally in modern times by some surgeons because its cutting edge is many times sharper than surgical steel, and much smoother, creating a cleaner cut with less tissue damage, inflammation, and scarring.
Pure obsidian is dark, but impurities can result in dark green, brown, black, and gray coloring. Other impurities result in stones known as snowflake obsidian, golden obsidian, apache tears, and rainbow obsidian.
Obsidian is found in many places in North America, Armenia, Italy, Mexico, Greece, and Scotland.
Obsidian is not technically a ‚Äúgemstone‚Äù but instead a naturally occurring glass, but it is used for jewelry nonetheless‚Äìparticularly apache tears and snowflake obsidian.
"
apatite,"Apatite is not a well known gemstone, and actually has more uses outside the field of jewelry. Apatite is a soft stone, and can be very brittle.
Apatite is a mineral that sits at a five on the Mohs Scale. Most commonly seen in green tones, it can also bee found in yellows, pinks, browns, violets, and blues. Apatite crystals typically grow in hexagonal (six sided) shapes.
The name apatite is derived from Greek meaning ‚Äúto deceive‚Äù likely because it was often mistaken for other, more valuable gemstones, like peridot, tourmaline, and emerald. Apatite is found in igneous, sedimentary, and metamorphic rock, but only the latter grows larger crystals suitable for jewelry.
Apatite is found in many different parts of the world: Eastern Canada, Germany, India, Madagascar, Brazil, Burma, Mexico, Czechoslovakia, Mozambique, Norway, South Africa, Spain, Sri Lanka, and the United States.
Because apatite is so soft, a lot of people will lean away from putting apatite in jewelry. However, if a setting is carefully chosen, it can result in a beautiful piece. When shopping for apatite, remember that the more intense the color, the more it is worth.
"
aquamarine,"Aquamarine is a brilliant, blue colored gemstone. The color of aquamarine ranges from pale blue to dark blue, and sometimes a bluish green. It is sometimes mistaken for the less expensive blue topaz.
Aquamarine sits at a 7.5 ‚Äì 8 on the Mohs scale (somewhere between quartz and topaz). It is a member of the beryl family, along with emerald, morganite, and bixbite (red emerald). Aquamarine‚Äôs name comes from Latin, meaning water and sea.
The best quality aquamarine sources are in Brazil. It is also found in Russia, Nigeria, Zambia, Madagascar, Mozambique, Afghanistan, Pakistan, and parts of the United States.
Aquamarine is a favorite stone of many:
In the past, sailors wore aquamarine to ward off seasickness and encourage safe travel. Some saw it as a stone of eternal youth.
Because aquamarine is a hard stone, it is safe for all forms of jewelry, such as rings, pendants, and earrings. It is also hard enough to be faceted for fine jewelry, making it suitable for engagement rings.
Clean your aquamarine often to keep it stunning. The color pales when dirt collects around the stone. Keep this in mind when buying lighter or pale colored stones.
Be careful not to mistake blue topaz gemstones for aquamarine. Topaz is beautiful as well, but is less expensive than aquamarine. Another imitation of aquamarine is a form of spinel called aquamarine spinel.
Aquamarine gems are often heat treated to enhance the color. When purchasing one of these stones, be sure to ask if it is natural or treated.
"
aragonite,"Aragonite is a calcium carbonate mineral, like calcite, but slightly harder. It can be found in various colors such as red, white, gray, and blue. Also like calcite, it can be found in the shells of many sea animals, and is a component of pearls.
"
aventurine,"Aventurine is a member of the quartz family, along with carnelian, amethyst, and citrine. It is commonly found in a forest green color, but can also be found in orange, yellow, brown, gray, and blue.
Aventurine can be recognized by the flecks of mineral inclusions that give it a sparkly look. Because of this, aventurine is sometimes mistaken for goldstone, which is a man-made sparkly glass material. Side by side, goldstone‚Äôs flecks look unnaturally uniform compared to aventurine.
Aventurine sits at a 6.5 on the Mohs Scale. Aventurine‚Äôs name comes from Italian, ‚ÄúA Ventura‚Äù, meaning ‚Äúby chance‚Äù.
Aventurine is found in many places in the world such as Brazil, China, Japan, Russia, Tanzania, and the United States. Green Aventurine is most commonly found in India, while Chile, Spain, and Russia account from good quality white, gray, orange, and gray material.
Aventurine is a common and inexpensive gemstone that is available in many different shapes and styles.
Aventurine is the star sign for Libra, and the planetary stone for Taurus. It is also the gemstone for your 8th year of marriage.
"
azurite,"Azurite is a deep dark blue colored mineral found all over the world. Azurite has been used in jewelry and other adornments since ancient times, and in modern times has been used for centuries as a pigment or dye as well as in jewelry.
Azurite is a fairly soft mineral, only a 3.5-4 on the Mohs scale of hardness. Azurite is often found growing alongside malachite, sometimes even growing together in one stone. Geologists and mineralogists use azurite to approximate the location of copper deposits as azurite (as well as malachite) are byproducts of copper, forming as the deposit weathers.
Azurite is found in many parts of the world including the United States, Australia, Chile, Peru, France, Namibia, Russia, and Egypt.
Azurite is a similar blue color to lapis lazuli, although the latter has glittery inclusions that are not present in azurite.
Azurite loses the intensity of its color over time if exposed to light, heat, and open air. Its softness means it will not hold up in all settings and because heating destroys azurite, only cold settings can be used. When wearing azurite, be careful to not wear it for long periods of time outside, and store it in a sealed container if possible away from harder stones that could scratch it. This will help maintain the brilliant color.
"
black tourmaline,"Tourmaline comes in several colors, like black, red, pink, green, and a green and pink combo called watermelon tourmaline. Black tourmaline is sometimes called schorl. Black tourmaline is the most affordable color.
"
bloodstone,"Bloodstone is a forest green variety of jasper (a type of chalcedony) with red inclusions that give it its name. Its mineral name is heliotrope. Sometimes yellow jasper is also found in bloodstone, but it is not typical.
It is a relatively hard stone, a 7 on the Mohs Scale of Hardness. Bloodstone is found primarily in India, but also found in Australia, Brazil, China, Russia, and the Czech Republic.
In the Middle Ages, people believed the red spots found on bloodstone were drops of the blood of Jesus that turned to stone when they fell from his body onto the earth during the crucifixion.
Bloodstone has a unique and uncommon color combination, which can sometimes make it challenging to combine with other beads in jewelry without the results seeming too ‚Äúbusy‚Äù. Therefore it may be best suited as a solo piece such as in a pendant.
No two pieces are alike. Quality, location, and other factors affect the look of a finished bloodstone piece, so matching new pieces with an existing piece can prove difficult. If you are purchasing a pendant in this stone, it would be worthwhile asking if there are any other accessories on site that were cut from the same slab, as this will likely be your best match.
Bloodstone was the traditional birthstone for March. March‚Äôs birthstone is now Aquamarine, with Bloodstone listed as one of its alternative stones.
"
blue chalcedony,"Chalcedony is a subset of quartz. Other chalcedony stones include agate, bloodstone, carnelian, chrysoprase, jasper, and onyx.
Blue chalcedony can be confused with blue lace agate. They can be a similar blue color, but blue lace agate has lacy white banding, whereas blue chalcedony is generally a solid color. Technically, agate is also a chalcedony, it just is not usually referred to that way.
"
blue lace agate,"Agate is a member of the quartz family of minerals and is a 7 on the Mohs scale of hardness. Blue lace agate contains bands of light blue and white and is fairly commonly available.
"
calcite,"Calcite is a soft stone consisting of calcium carbonate. It is abundantly available and occurs in a variety of colors, and ranges from transparent to opaque.
"
carnelian,"A reddish-orange, or reddish-brown colored gemstone from the chalcedony family of quartz. It has a warm, uniform, and easily distinguishable color.
Carnelian sits at a 6.5 ‚Äì 7 on the Mohs scale. It is a member of the quartz family. Carnelian is derived from the Latin word meaning horn. Carnelian is also spelled ‚Äòcornelian‚Äô and has also been referred to as Mecca Stone, Pigeon‚Äôs blood Agate, and Sadoine.
The best quality carnelian is found in India but it is also found in many other parts of the world including Uruguay, Brazil, Japan, Botswana, and Madagascar. In the United States, carnelian can be found in Texas, North Carolina, Colorado, and Florida.
Carnelian  is relatively inexpensive. It is often found in antique jewelry and provides a perfect surface for engraving. Carnelian is usually fashioned in a cabochon cut and accents especially well on silver. Its translucency is especially apparent in pendants, and it is how many people prefer to wear this beautiful gemstone. Carnelian works well with fall colors.
Carnelian is sometimes listed as a birthstone for August and the astrological sign Virgo.
"
celestite,"Celestite (also known as Celestine) is a soft mineral made of strontium sulfate. It is only around 3 on the Mohs scale of hardness, which means it‚Äôs important to protect your celestite gems and jewelry from getting scratched by metal and harder gemstones.
Celestite is most commonly sold in the light blue-grey color, although other colors exist.
"
charoite,"Charoite is striking purple stone found only in a small area of Siberia in Russia near the Chara River, which it was named after. It is a silicate mineral and was discovered in the 1940s. It is also sometimes called cherolite.
It ranges in shade from purple to lavender and has swirly patterns that can include white and black that are reminiscent of a Van Gogh painting.
"
chrysocolla,"Chrysocolla is a very soft stone, only a 2 to 4 on the Mohs Scale, making it hard to turn into jewelry unless it is mixed with a harder stone. It is found in a bluish green color that reminds many people of how earth looks from space.
Chrysocolla grows in large sizes and in not considered rare or hard to find. It is found in the Czech Republic, Israel, England, Congo, and the United States. In the U.S. Chrysocolla is found in Utah, Arizona, New Mexico, and Pennsylvania. Chrysocolla is often found alongside quartz, copper minerals, azurite, and limonite.
Chrysocolla is very soft, which makes it difficult on its own to work with. This beautiful stone can be found, however, mixed with quartz or in a druzy style that is attractive and easier to work with.
"
chrysoprase,"Chrysoprase is a member of the quartz family and is a variety of chalcedony. It is usually found in a beautiful apple green color, but sometimes is found in a deeper green. Chrysoprase is translucent and very bright in color.
Chrysoprase sits at a 6-7 on the Mohs Scale. The name chrysoprase comes from Greek meaning gold leek. Chrysoprase is also sometimes referred to as ‚ÄúAustralian Jade‚Äù.
The best quality chrysoprase seems to be coming from Australia, but it is also found in Queensland, Germany, Tanzania, Poland, Russia, and Brazil. In the United States it is found in Arizona and California.
Chrysoprase is one of the rarer members of the quartz family and many people consider it to be a prized piece in their collections. Chrysoprase unique color comes from the traces of nickel found in it.
"
diamonds,"Diamonds are pure carbon and are the hardest of any stone. They are generally thought of as clear, but actually come in many colors.
Raw or rough diamonds can also be used for metaphysical or spiritual healing and are much, much less expensive than cut diamonds.
Simulated diamonds are not diamonds, they just look like they could pass for diamonds. Many stones are sold to look like diamonds, such as cubic zirconia, white sapphire, spinel, or zircon.
Synthetic diamonds are lab-created diamonds. They are the same material as diamonds that are mined from the ground, but they are human-made.
Pave diamonds are real diamonds that are very small, and generally of lower quality that are set as accents in one or more rows. Pave is therefore a type of setting rather than a type of diamond. It is sometimes used in combination with a larger, higher quality diamond to enhance the brilliance of the piece, as seen here.
"
diopside,"Diopside is a pyroxene silicate mineral with a monoclinic crystal structure. It is a medium-hard stone, sitting at around 5-6 on the Mohs scale.
Green is the most common type of gemstone-quality Diopside, often called Chrome Diopside due to chrome being the reason it is bright green. The second most common color is dark grey or black, which is sometimes cut to show a cat-eye or star effect and called Black Star Diopside.
"
dumortierite,"Dumortierite is an aluminum boro-silicite mineral and is usually a dark blue or indigo color. Violet, red-brown, or blue-green dumortierite can also be found. Dumortierite crystallizes in the orthorhombic system and can be found in aluminum-rich metamorphic rock. Dumortierite can also be found as inclusions in quartz. Besides jewelry, dumortierite is also used to manufacture porcelain.
"
emerald,"Emerald is a green variety of beryl. Emerald is considered a precious gem, and has been prized since ancient Egypt. The finest emeralds come from Columbia and the South American region in general.
"
fluorite,"Pure fluorite is actually white or colorless, but trace minerals give it many colors. Fluorite is transparent in most cases. The most commonly recognized fluorite color is a purple-blue mix but it is also found in blue, green, red and yellow colors.
Fluorite sits at a 4 on the Mohs Scale, which is very soft. The word ‚Äúflourescent‚Äù is derived from flourite. Flourescence is the property of emitting light that has been absorbed previously‚Äìin essence, glowing. Generally minerals that are flourescent absorb ultra-violet light and then emit visible light, therefore the effect can only be seen by shining a UV light (black light) on them.
Not all flourite is flourescent. Pieces harvested side by side from the same site can respond differently to black light‚Äìthe effect depends on the exact mineral makeup of each specimen.
Fluorite is found in many parts of the world including Germany, Austria, Switzerland, England, Norway, Mexico, Canada (Ontario), and the U.S. The largest producer of fluorite in the U.S. is Illinois, and is in fact their state mineral. Fluorite is also found in Missouri, Oklahoma, Colorado, New Mexico, Kentucky, Arizona, Ohio, New Hampshire, New York and Texas.
Flourite is relatively inexpensive, and surprisingly durable despite its softness, making it an excellent option for many designs.
"
garnets,"Garnet is popularly known as a dark red gemstone, but it actually a group of gemstones that can be a variety of colors. It has been found as early as the Bronze Age and was known in Egypt and ancient Sumeria.
The six subtypes of garnet are:
Almandine and pyrope garnet are the most common in jewelry.
Garnet was named after the pomegranate and is the birthstone for January.
"
golden obsidian,"A type of obsidian which occurs when gas bubbles from the original lava flow are trapped in the obsidian as it is forming. The impurities of the gasses cause a golden sheen to occur, giving the obsidian a golden appearance.
"
green amethyst,"Prasiolite (more commonly known as ‚Äúgreen amethyst‚Äù) is a pale green form of quartz. There is a small amount of natural prasiolite, but almost all prasiolite on the market is artificially produced by heat-treaing amethyst. Amethyst usually turns yellow or orange, producing citrine, but with the addition of radiation, it turns green. 
Technically, amethyst is by definition purple, so it doesn‚Äôt make a lot of sense to call prasiolite ‚Äúgreen amethyst‚Äù, but the name seems to have stuck.
"
green tourmaline,"Tourmaline comes in several colors such as black, pink, green, blue, and red. It is a silicate mineral with a hardness is a 7 on the Mohs scale. It has a distinctive striated appearance because of the columnar formations it grows in.
Green tourmaline is sometimes called Verdelite.
"
hematite,"Hematite is the mineral form of iron oxide. Hematite beads are striking, being shiny and black when polished. They are heavy for their size.
There are man-made stones called magnetic hematite, hematine, hemalyke, or hemalike that look very similar to hematite and are far more commonly sold for jewelry-making than natural hematite. Some are made of a mixture of ground up hematite and other minerals, and some are made entirely of other minerals. They are often labelled as hematite, so check your sources when buying this stone.
"
herkimer diamonds,"Herkimer Diamonds are somewhat of a misnomer, as they are actually a form of quartz in a diamond shape (i.e. double-terminated). They are found near Herkimer County, NY.
Some Herkimer Diamonds are smoky, but most are clear. While there are similarly-shaped quartz crystals found elsewhere, the ones near Herkimer are known for being especially hard and glossy.
"
howlite,"Howlite is white and gray with dark gray marbling. It is a relatively recently discovered mineral that was found by gypsum miners. It is a soft stone, around 3.5 on the Mohs hardness scale (between Calcite and Fluorite).
Howlite is always white and gray in its natural state, but because it is porous, it is often dyed different colors. It is most often dyed blue to imitate turquoise, as its veining pattern gives it a superficial resemblance. Because of this, Howlite is sometimes called ‚Äúwhite turquoise‚Äù but it is not actually related to turquoise. Other names for it include ‚Äúbuffalo stone‚Äù.
How to tell them apart:
"
iolite,"A translucent violet gem which is also called cordierite, a silicate of aluminum and magnesium. Shows two or more colors depending on how it is viewed. The name comes from the Greek word for violet. It is mined in Brazil, Madagascar, India, Sri Lanka, and Burma.
"
jade,"Jade is actually two different minerals referred to by the same name. For centuries, two separate minerals were referred to and traded as jade because of their similarities. By the time a French mineralogist realized they were two different gems in the 1800s, it was too late. Today, they are differentiated into jadeite and nephrite, but often the two are still just called and sold as ‚Äújade‚Äù. Nephrite jade has long been revered by the Chinese, where it is called ‚ÄòYu‚Äô. It is believed to reduce stress, and prolong life.
Nephrite Jade is a 6 to 6.5 and Jadeite is a 6 to 7 on the Mohs scale. Neither jade is an exceptionally hard stone, but both are very tough due to their microcrystalline structure. Because of this durability, jade was used by earlier civilizations for axes and weapons. Jade is an important part of the Chinese wedding ceremony as it is considered the concentrated essence of love. It has also been carved into ornaments, beads, and statues.
Jadeite is the more expensive variety and was originally introduced to Europe from the Americas where it was found by the conquistadors. It is actually not found in China. This variety of jade is found primarily in Burma and Guatemala. It comes in a wide range of colors including green, mottled green and white, whitish gray, pink, brown, mauve, yellow, orange, and lavender. Green jade of this variety is usually an apple green or emerald color. Colored jade (except green) is usually pale and unevenly tinted. It is more expensive because it is rarer, found in only a dozen places worldwide.
Nephrite jade is more common than jadeite and is found in mostly dark green shades. This type of jade is considered to be the ‚Äúold and true Chinese jade‚Äù. Nephrite is slightly softer than it‚Äôs counterpart and is found in many countries including China, Russia, New Zealand, the United States, and Canada (British Columbia).
Due to jade‚Äôs toughness, it can be worn virtually anywhere. It is often carved and cut into cabochon styles for pendants, earrings, and rings. Jade can also be fashioned into a complete ring, much like the hematite rings you see. There are, however, many imitations of jade. ‚ÄúNew Jade‚Äù is actually a gemstone called serpentine but looks almost identical. The easiest way to tell real jade apart is a basic scratch test (although this still isn‚Äôt a definitive test). Real jade should not be easily scratched by a knife while serpentine and many other imposters are. When purchasing jade, just make sure you trust the source and you should be fine. White jade can also be died to produce bright colors.
"
jasper,"Jasper is a member of the quartz family, specifically an opaque aggregate of microgranular quartz with various inclusions. It sits at a 6.5 ‚Äì 7 on the Mohs scale. Its name comes from Greek ‚Äújaspis‚Äù, meaning ‚Äúspotted stone‚Äù.
Jasper is found in many colors and patterns, resulting in many names for different varieties. Jasper types are usually named for their pattern. Colors of jasper include grayish blue, green, off-white, white, yellow, orange, red, pink, black, and brown. Jasper very rarely has a uniform color, as it often has other materials mixed in with it. There are over 50 varieties of jasper, often with a blotch like, or vein like pattern.
Jasper is one of the oldest known gemstones, and was very popular in ancient times. It has been written about in Greek, Hebrew, Assyrian, Persian and Latin prints, as well as the Bible.
Jasper is found in many locations including Canada, USA, Africa, Australia, China, France, Germany, India, Italy, Russia, Sicily, and Venezuela.
Most kinds of jasper are common and as such relatively inexpensive, and available in a wide variety of sizes and styles.
"
jet,"Jet is a type of lignite, a brownish-black low-grade variety of coal. Coal is a sedimentary rock that forms when decomposing organic materials are compressed under extreme pressure over long periods of time.
Jet is a non-crystalline organic gemstone formed by natural processes, like amber, pearl, and shungite. Jet sometimes contains inclusions of pyrite, giving it some sparkle.
Jet has been used in carvings and amulets since the Neolithic period. In Rome it was used in protective amulets, and the Victorians used it for rosary beads and jewelry to wear in periods of mourning. Jet is soft compared to say, sapphire, but it can be polished to a high-sheen and is relatively durable as a gemstone.
Whitby Jet is produced in Whitby, England, and is considered very high quality.
French Jet is not actually jet‚Äìit is black glass made to simulate jet. It became popular in the 19th century and is still easy to find in antiques. Real jet is lighter and warmer to the touch than glass.
Jet is sometimes referred to as black amber. This may be because they both can let off an electric charge when rubbed. However, amber is fossilized tree resin and forms in a completely different manner to jet, so this is a misnomer.
Azabache is the name for jet in Spanish, and generally refers to jet from the northern coast region of Spain. It is used as a protective stone in Spain and is very popular along the Camino de Santiago pilgrimage trails that run through Europe to the Spanish coast.

kunzite,"Kunzite is a pale pink to violet form of spodumene, a silicate mineral in the pyroxene group. It‚Äôs color comes from manganese. Kunzite is often heated and/or irradiated to enhance its color. It was discovered in 1902 by George Kunz, while working for Tiffany.
"
kyanite,"Kyanite is an aluminum silicate mineral that is often blue, but can also be found in many other colors, include white, black, green, orange, pink, and gray.
In its raw form it is often sold in spear shapes, which can flake off in splinters, so it‚Äôs good to take care when handling them.
"
labradorite,"Labradorite is a variety of feldspar. Although it has a dirty gray color in the rough, cut stones have a metallic lustre and an iridescent sheen suggestive of the Northern Lights (Aurora Borealis). When seen at the right angle, various shades of vivid blue, green, gold, purple, and other colors are revealed. These crystals are usually cut with at least one flat surface to bring out these colors.
Labradorite was named after the peninsula of Labrador in Canada, where it was discovered in 1770. It has since been found in other areas around the world. It is a 6-6.5 on the Mohs scale and is not expensive.
Spectrolite is a variety of labradorite with intense colors, originally found in Finland.
"
lapis lazuli,"A lovely blue gemstone composed mainly of lazurite and calcite. It was popular in ancient Egypt.
"
larimar,"A form of pale blue pectolite, usually containing inclusions of blue-green and white. It is only found in the Dominican Republic. Due to its rareness, it is often simulated by dying quartz a pale blue.
"
lepidolite,"Lepidolite is a mica, a group of glittery silicate minerals. It is sometimes found as an inclusion in tourmaline and quartz, giving a bit of shine to those stones. It is soft, a 2.5-3 on the Mohs scale. In its raw form it can be scaly, with pieces that flake off. It can be translucent and has a pearly luster. It is most often found in shades of purple, pink and lilac, although it can also be found in gray or yellow. It is so high in lithium it is actually mined as a source of lithium, and is sometimes called ‚Äúlithium mica‚Äù.
Due to its softness, avoid using any harsh cleaners on your lepidolite jewelry‚Äìuse warm soapy water and dry with a soft cloth. Store your lepidolite in its own pouch away from harder gemstones that might scratch it. Avoid wearing it during exercise or exposing it to high heat or pressure. With good care, lepidolite jewelry should last for many decades.
"
magnesite,"Magnesite is a soft magnesium carbonate mineral. Magnesite is generally white, but can be yellow, brown, or gray. It looks similar to howlite, and is commonly dyed to mimic turquoise or simply to create a more colorful stone. It is often mislabelled as ‚Äúwhite turquoise‚Äù, but it‚Äôs not actually related to turquoise.
In addition to being used in beads and jewelry, magnesite is used in some industrial processes.
"
mahogany obsidian,"Mahogany Obsidian is a form of obsidian that is reddish-brown with black spots or stripes. It is named after the wood of mahogany trees.
"
malachite,"Malachite is found alongside copper deposits, and is very similar to azurite, another secondary mineral of copper. It forms when copper minerals reacts with carbonated water or limestone.
Malachite is a mineral that sits at a 3.5-4 on the Mohs scale of hardness. Malachite‚Äôs name comes from the Greek word ‚Äúmolochitis‚Äù meaning mallow-green stone. It is very rarely found in single crystals.
Malachite is only found in shades of green and has a very obvious and unique look. Imitation pieces may have black or white banding, although this mineral is rarely imitated as it is found in relative abundance.
Malachite is mined on a large scale in the Ural Mountains and is also found in Congo, Canada, Tsumeb, Namibia, Russia, Mexico, Zaire, Australia, England and Israel. In the United States, malachite has been found alongside copper deposits in California, Nevada, Utah, Pennsylvania, and Tennessee. Archeological evidence suggests this mineral has been mined and smelted for well over 3000 years.
Malachite is very soft, so if you are hard on your jewelry in general, malachite may not be for you. It is recommended that you do not use an ultrasonic cleanser on malachite.
"
moonstone,"A feldspar mineral gemstone that is pale and iridescent. In appearance it can be similar to some opals, although they are chemically different. Opals can be many different colors, and their iridescence contains many colors; in contrast, moonstone is always milky-white and its iridescence is limited to gray, peach, and blue tones.
"
morganite,"Morganite is pink beryl. This makes it related to emerald (green beryl) and aquamarine (blue beryl). The pink color of morganite is from manganese. It was named after J.P. Morgan. It is found in Madagascar, the United States, as well as Brazil and Africa.
High-grade translucent morganite is often faceted for fine jewelry, but you can also find rough specimens and lower-grade opaque semi-precious beads. The delicate peach color is often sought after for engagement and wedding rings.

"
onyx,"Onyx is a form of quartz that can come in almost any color. The pure black form is the most famous, especially for beads. Outside of beading, the most common form has the appearance of parallel lines running through the stone in alternating bands. Sardonyx is a banded variety of onyx with shades of red and brown. Much of what is sold as onyx is actually agate that has been stained.
"
pearls,"A mineral object produced within a living shelled mollusk. Pearls are composed of calcium carbonate (aragonite and calcite) deposited in concentric layers. Classic pearls are perfectly round. Baroque pearls refer to all the other irregular shaped pearls. Most pearls are cultured or farmed as natural pearls are extremely rare. Pearls are iridescent and classically white, but also come in other colors like pink, brown, and black.
Cultured pearls are not made of pearl material all the way through‚Äìthey are formed by a non-pearl base which has a thin layer of pearl around it.
"
peridot,"A yellowish green gemstone, composed of silica, magnesia, and iron. Common in certain volcanic rocks. It ranges in color from olive to lime green. It has been mined in Egypt for thousands of years. It can also be found in Pakistan, Burma, South Africa, and Brazil.
"
petrified wood,"Petrified wood forms when a tree or tree-like plant becomes fossilized and all of the matter in the tree is replaced by minerals. The minerals (usually quartz) replace the organic tissue so slowly that the original form is retained, allowing you to see the plant‚Äôs organic structures down to the microscopic level.
Petrification can only happen under specific circumstances. The plant has to be buried in such a way that no oxygen is present so rotting cannot occur, and there is mineral-rich water present that can bring the minerals to replace the organic tissue.
Petrified wood can be found at sites all over the world, often in large swaths of petrified forests that all got buried at the same time under ideal conditions.
"
picture jasper,"Picture jasper is a type of jasper that forms from mud that drips into gas pockets in molten lava. The resulting pattern resembles a picture or landscape.
"
pietersite,"Pietersite is a mottled brown, gray, blue, and gold form of quartz. It contains Tiger Eye (another form of quartz), which gives it the chatoyancy effect. It is only found in China and Namibia.

"
pink tourmaline,"Tourmaline is a silicate mineral that comes in several colors such as pink, green, black, red, and blue. It‚Äôs hardness is a 7 on the Mohs scale, and is fairly rare in most colors. Black tourmaline is the most abundant color. It grows in columnar formations which give it a striped or striated appearance.
"
prehnite,"Prehnite is usually a soft yellow-green color, sometimes with white or clear mixed in. It is a silicate mineral containing calcium and aluminum, with an orthorhombic crystal structure. It is a 6-6.5 on the Mohs scale of hardness. Learn more about the mineral properties of Prehnite on Wikipedia.
"
pyrite,"Pyrite is an iron sulfide also known as ‚Äúfool‚Äôs gold‚Äù due to its superficial resemblance to gold and it being much more common. The name pyrite comes from the greek word for fire, because you can produce a spark when hitting two pieces of pyrite together, or striking it against steel. Pyrite is used in industry to produce sulfur dioxide and sulfuric acid. It is also sometimes used as a component in lithium batteries. Historically it has been used in radios and inside early firearms, and in ancient times it was polished to use as a mirror. It is also sometimes found as a replacement mineral in fossils. It forms into various crystal shapes, including strikingly large cubes. It is found all over the world, but larger and more prized specimens have been found in Bolivia, Spain, Italy, and Germany.
Pyrite was used in marcasite jewelry, as it is similar to marcasite but more durable. Marcasite jewelry consists of small pieces of pyrite set into silver, and has been made since ancient Greece. It enjoyed a period of popularity in the Victorian era, and today‚Äôs marcasite jewelry tends to replicate these designs for a ‚Äúvintage‚Äù look.
Pyrite can be used alone in jewelry, but it can also be found as inclusions inside other gemstones such as lapis lazuli.

"
rainforest jasper,"Rainforest Jasper is a rhyolite (volcanic rock) with a green-brown background mottled with other colors such as yellow, brown, and peach. Calling it jasper is misleading, because jaspers are sedimentary rocks, not igneous (volcanic), and rainforest jasper seems to be named jasper purely due to visual similarities with other jaspers. Compositionally, it is more similar to granite than chalcedony. In the jewelry industry, you will see the same rock referred to as ‚Äúrainforest jasper‚Äù and ‚Äúrainforest rhyolite‚Äù.
"
rhodochrosite,"Rhodochrosite is a soft mineral sometimes confused with rhodonite. It is made up of manganese carbonate. In its pure form, it is a vibrant bright pink color. Often times, calcium and other minerals find there way into the mix, the end result being a beautiful light pink color with white banding. Occasionally you will also find brown and white rhodochrosite.
Rhodochrosite is a soft stone, only a 3.5-4 on the Mohs Scale of Hardness. Rhodochrosite is very rarely faceted, most often it is cut in a cabochon style to set into jewelry. The word rhodochrosite is derived from Greek and means rose-colored. Rhodochrosite is the state mineral of Colorado and is often found in silver mines. Until people started actively looking for good quality rhodochrosite specimens, they were routinely discarded in mine dump piles.
Rhodochrosite is found in Argentina, Peru, Romania, Poland, Canada, and the United States.
Rhodochrosite is usually found with white banding throughout, sometimes with other colors as well. Rhodonite, on the other hand, is found in more of a flat color, sometimes with black inclusions.
"
rhodonite,"Rhodonite is a manganese inosilicate mineral. It is rose-red to brownish-red, frequently with inclusions of black manganese oxide that can give it a mottled appearance.
"
rose quartz,"A pink variety of quartz, that ranges from very pale pink to deep reddish pink, and from opaque to transparent. It is readily available and inexpensive.
"
ruby,"A fiery red gemstone that comes from the corundum mineral (sapphires come from the same mineral). Corundum is considered one of the hardest minerals on earth and the ruby is prized for its hardness, durability, luster, and rarity. Deemed one of the most valuable gemstones on earth, large, transparent rubies are even more valuable than diamonds.
"
ruby zoisite,"Ruby Zoisite is green zoisite with ruby inclusions. These two gemstones occur together enough that they are referred to as their own type of crystal, sometimes called anyolite.
Zoisite is a calcium aluminum silicate mineral in the epidote group, first discovered in 1805. It can be found in many other colors besides green, like white, brown, blue, purple, clear, pink, and yellow. Blue zoisite is known as Tanzanite.
"
rutilated quartz,"Rutilated Quartz is clear quartz or smoky quartz with hair-like inclusions of the mineral rutile. The hairs are usually golden colored, but can also be silver, copper, or black. It is sometimes referred to as ‚ÄúVenus hair‚Äù.
It is sometimes confused with tourmalinated quartz, which is clear or milky quartz with tourmaline inclusions. They looks similar except in tourmalinated quartz, the hairs are usually black (or sometimes dark green).
"
sapphire,"Sapphire is a variety of corundum, a very hard mineral that sits at 9 on the Mohs scale of hardness.
While most commonly thought of as blue, sapphires actually come in a range of colors, like violet, pink, white, green, yellow, and black. Red corundum is called ruby.
"
scolecite,"Scolecite is a calcium silicate mineral in the zeolite group. It is most commonly found in Iceland and India and can range from almost colorless to creamy white or yellow. Its striated prismatic crystal clusters give it a silky and smooth appearance.
"
selenite,"Selenite is a form of gypsum, a soft mineral with a hardness of 2 on the Mohs scale. Its chemical composition is calcium sulfate dihydrate and it can form into huge crystals many feet across. It is related to alabaster and desert rose, but not to selenium. It‚Äôs name derives from the Greek name for the moon. It has a striated appearance (consisting of parallel lines) and a silky sheen. Selenite is usually transparent, colorless, or white, although can sometimes have a light coloring from the presence of other minerals.
Selenite can begin to dissolve in water, so it is important to never get it wet.
Because selenite is so soft and can dissolve in water, it‚Äôs not usually made into jewelry except for serious crystal fans. If you do wear it as jewelry, be careful to not expose it to the elements, and perhaps only wear it for a short period of time such as in a ritual.
"
seraphinite,"Seraphinite is a dark green to gray gem form of chinochlore, which is in the chlorite group of minerals. It was discovered in Siberia, Russia in the 1800s and is only found there. It is a soft stone, around a mineral hardness of 2-4 on the Mohs scale, so care should be taken with jewelry and Seraphinite stones when storing them with much harder crystals.
Seraphinite is named after the Seraphim, the highest order of angels due to the stone containing feather-like chatoyant silver fibers that shimmer like angel wings.
"
serpentine,"Serpentine technically refers to a group of related minerals that often occur together in the same rock. Rocks composed of one or more types of serpentine are called serpentinite. However for gemstone purposes this distinction is generally ignored and rocks containing serpentine are just called serpentine regardless of their composition.
One member of the serpentine group, chrysotile, forms into asbestos, a fibrous formation that can occur in several different minerals. Asbestos has many industrial applications but is also carcinogenic. However, it is only dangerous in microscopic powder form when that powder becomes airborne and is inhaled. As long as it is safely sealed inside a rock, is poses no danger. (It should also be noted that silica, which is present in many gemstones, causes silicosis when inhaled in dust form‚Äìif you are grinding or drilling gemstones, be sure to understand the safety concerns).
Serpentine ranges in color from pale yellowish green through various shades of green to almost black, often with a mottled or scaly appearance. It is soft in terms of gemstones, around 2.5-4 on the Mohs scale. It It is usually opaque although it can sometimes be translucent.
Serpentine is found in many places around the world. It is sometimes passed for jade and has been called ‚Äúfalse jade‚Äù.
"
shungite,"Shungite is a lustrous black rock consisting almost entirely of carbon, with a number of other minerals distributed throughout. Its origin appears to be biological, like coal or oil. It has also been found to contain fullerenes, very interesting carbon structures with unique properties that were named after Buckminster Fuller (also called buckyballs). However, it should be noted that  these only occur in very trace amounts in shungite.
Shungite has been found to have antibacterial properties useful in purifying water, and is being studied for potential medical applications. However, this may be due to its carbon content rather than particular aspects of shungite‚Äìcarbon is commonly used in water filters already.
"
smoky quartz,"A brownish-gray variety of quartz that ranges from transparent to almost opaque. Smoky quartz can be created artificially by irradiating clear quartz.
"
snowflake obsidian,"Snowflake obsidian is a form of black obsidian that contains small white crystal impurities made of crystobalite. The end result is a beautiful black color with distinctive grayish white patterns throughout the surface.
Obsidian is a natural glass which is formed through volcanic activity by the cooling of molten lava. Snowflake obsidian forms when the mineral cristobalite is present and gets trapped in the obsidian as it cools. Cristobalite is a silica, similar to quartz but with a different crystal structure. As obsidian is a glass and cristobalite is a crystal, snowflake obsidian is essentially a lot of tiny crystals trapped in black glass rock.
"
sodalite,"Sodalite is a royal blue silicate mineral with white streaks of calcite.
"
spinel,"Spinel is a fairly hard mineral composed of magnesium aluminum oxide. It comes in many shades from transparent (colorless) to shades of pink, red, blue, yellow, green, black, and brown. It is sometimes mistaken for other precious stones, particularly ruby. It is also sometimes artificially created for industrial use.
"
sugilite,"Sugilite is a rare pinkish-purple silicate mineral first found in Japan in 1944. It has since been found in various areas around the world, but most of the pieces you find on the market are mined in South Africa.
"
sunstone,"Sunstone is an orange to reddish-brown variety of feldspar with sparkling metallic inclusions. This sparkle effect is sometimes called aventurescence and is also exhibited by aventurine and the manufactured glass called goldstone. Consequently, sunstone is sometimes called, ‚Äúaventurine feldspar‚Äù. 
In the case of sunstone, the metallic inclusions are usually copper, but can also be hematite or the mineral goethite. It is the flatness of the inclusions that give the appearance of glitter, but that also means the cut of the stone matters in how much light gets reflected off of the metal platelets. Sunstone is transparent to translucent and sits at a 6 on the Mohs hardness scale.
"
tanzanite,"Tanzanite was named after Tanzania where it was first discovered, but it is also referred to as blue zoisite. It is primarily found in blue or blue-violet although it can also be found in golden-brown (which turns blue when heated).
"
tiger eye,"A golden-brown banded variety of quartz that exhibits chatoyancy, or the ‚Äúcat‚Äôs eye effect‚Äù‚Äìa luminous streak that moves as you rotate the stone. Faceting tiger eye can sometimes dull this effect, so usually it is worn as round beads or cabochons.
"
tiger iron,"Tiger iron is an aggregate stone containing bands of tiger eye, red jasper, and hematite. The combination is golden brown, dark red, and bluish-gray. The look of each piece depends on the relative quantities of each. Tiger iron is sometimes called ‚Äúmugglestone‚Äù, but there is no relation to the Harry Potter books. It was named after Mucklestone in England, where it was first found.
Tiger eye and jasper are both forms of quartz.
"
topaz,"Topaz is a hard stone, an eight on the Mohs Scale of Hardness. It can be found in many colors, including red, orange, peach, pink, gold, yellow, blue, brown, green, white, and clear. There are many techniques used to alter the color of topaz as well (more on this below). Most commercial topaz comes from Brazil, but it is also found in Sri Lanka, India, Russia, U.S., Canada, Mexico, Italy, Japan, and many other places around the world.
Topaz is associated with the astrological sign Sagittarius, and is the birthstones for November (yellow topaz and citrine). Blue topaz is a birthstone for December, and pure topaz (clear/white) is often used in place of diamond, the birthstones for April.
Topaz is also the anniversary stone for the fourth, nineteenth, and twenty third years of marriage. The word topaz means fire in Sanskrit. Because of its hardness, topaz is usually faceted before setting it into jewelry.
Topaz is a stone that is often altered, creating colors not found naturally, or enhancing natural colors to be more vibrant. For example, blue topaz is often irradiated to enhance the color. Topaz is also exposed to titanium vapors, creating mystic topaz. These techniques, and others, have allowed for a whole new generation of topaz stones to emerge, and have allowed mainstream customers to purchase these beautiful stones.
"
tourmaline,"Tourmaline is a silicate mineral with a hardness of 7 on the Moh‚Äôs scale. It is found all over the world and comes in a variety of colors including shades of red, pink, yellow, black, green, and blue. Although it can be found many places, fine specimens useful for jewelry are still considered rare and valuable. It occurs naturally in columnar formations that are often triangular in cross-section.
"
watermelon tourmaline,"Watermelon tourmaline is named for its coloring‚Äìsome pieces have a pink center surrounded by green, like a watermelon, while others just have pink and green together in the same stone.
